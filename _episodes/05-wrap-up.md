Getting help:
* [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com): dominant Q&A site for everything programming related (typically would end up here after a Google search)
* [Biostarts](https://www.biostars.org): Q&A site for bioinformatics related questions
* If you really get stuck, ask questions in the course's MS Team channel!

Further course materials (in the same style of the course):
* [Software carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/): collection of official and community contributed course materials on learning programming languages (also R and Matlab) and related computational tools 
* [Data carpentry](https://datacarpentry.org/lessons/): huge collection of official and community contributed course materials on data science & engineering (also covering Biology a bit)

Good coding practices and advise:
* [Ten simple rules for biologists learning to program](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005871): excellent advise for newcomers
* [Good Computational Biology practices](https://computer-aided-biotech.github.io/better-cb/): (somewhat opinionated) advised on good practices in computational biology (work in progress ...)

Python libraries relevant for biotech (not covered in the course):

* [Biopython](https://biopython.org/): work with biological sequences
* [Pydna](https://pydna.readthedocs.io/): molecular cloning, PCR simulation, primer design, ...
* [scikit-image](https://scikit-image.org/): image processing and computer vision (counting colonies, cells, ...)
* [auto-sklearn](https://automl.github.io/auto-sklearn/master/): auto-ML on of scikit-learn
* [opentrons](https://docs.opentrons.com/v2/): program opentrons liquid handlers using Python
* [cobrapy](https://opencobra.github.io/cobrapy/): work with metabolic models
* [cameo](http://cameo.bio/): use metabolic models for cell factory design

Popular visualization and dashboard libraries (not covered in the course):
* [plotly](https://plotly.com/python/): plotting tool with interfaces for many different programming languages (including Python, R, Matlab, ...) producing interactive visualizations
* [dash](https://dash.plotly.com/dash-bio): create dashboards similar to Tableau, Spotfire, Microsoft Power BI etc.using Python code (similar to R shiny; uses plotly for the charts)
* [Bokeh](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/): interactive visualizations with sliders and buttons etc.
* [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/): good statistical visualization with error bars, violin plots etc. (written on top of matplotlib)

Finding more packages:
* [The Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/)
