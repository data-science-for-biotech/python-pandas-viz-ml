modern industrial and pre-industrial fecal microbiota were compared to some ancient samples (palaeofaeces).

{: .output}

This is the output from a particular software (MetaPhlAn2) for estimating microbial abundances from metagenomic sequencing (MGS) data. The single letter with double underscore prefix in the first column denotes the taxonomic rank. Multiple ranks
are divided by `|` and describe a lineage.

The first two rows in the table describe the type of sample and a sample identifier.

~~~
{: .output}

Due to the sample identifiers in every column, they are all of type `object` rather than numerical.

Let's make this tidy!

### Tidying up

#### Sample meta information

We will split the information that describes the samples. We will also get to know
another Pandas feature, the [pipe](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.pipe.html) which allows us to chain function calls. In order to make full use of the chaining, we also need a function to assign values to the data frame.


~~~
def set_element(df, row_idx, col_idx, value):
    result = df.copy()
    result.iat[row_idx, col_idx] = value
    return result
~~~
{: .language-python}

Our meta information is in the first two rows. We then set meaningful names in
the currently empty fields. Next we set the first column as the row index. Then
we transpose the table such that our two rows become two columns and reset the
index of that transposed data frame such that we end up with a range index starting
at zero.


~~~
observations = (
    raw.iloc[:2, :]
    .pipe(set_element, 0, 0, "label")
    .pipe(set_element, 1, 0, "sample")
    .set_index(0)
    .T.reset_index(drop=True)
)
~~~

The result looks as follows:

Now that we have the sample meta information in a tidy format, it is time that
we clean up the relative abundances.

#### Relative abundances

There is a lot of information contained in the first column. Let's split this
information into multiple columns. The taxonomic rank deserves its own column so
that we can later filter on it. For convenience, we also keep the kingdom of every sample for later data filtering.

Our strategy is then:

* Split the strings in the first column on `|`
* The first element in the resulting list is the highest taxonomic rank, i.e., kingdom
* The last element in the list is the lowest taxonomic rank, this will be anything from kingdom down to strain level
* We remove the rank prefix to end up with nice names

def transform_taxonomic_rank(df):
    result = df.rename(columns={0: "taxonomy"})
    lineage = result["taxonomy"].str.split("|")
    result["kingdom"] = (
        lineage.map(lambda element: element[0])
        .str.split("__", n=1, expand=True)
        .iloc[:, -1]
    )
    result[["rank", "taxonomy"]] = lineage.map(lambda element: element[-1]).str.split(

From our inspection of the data, we decide that it's best to remove the abundance of unclassified sequencing reads. In addition, I don't trust the read assignment to virus genomes and they don't play a large role. We remove those as well.

Similarly to before, we then set the new columns as the row index, then we convert all abundances from `object` types to `float` types, transpose the data frame, and reset the index again for a nice range starting from zero.


~~~
abundance = (
    transformed.query("kingdom != 'Viruses' and rank != 'unclassified'")
    .set_index(["kingdom", "rank", "taxonomy"])
    .astype(float)
    .T.reset_index(drop=True)
)
~~~
{: .language-python}

We have chosen three columns as the index here. That means, we are creating an
index with multiple levels (a [`pandas.MultiIndex`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/advanced.html)). Multi indeces can be tricky to work with. We will just use them here
but do not expect a full understanding.

Relative abundances are percentage numbers of the counts. They apply to each taxonomic rank so that adding up the relative abundances per rank should be
close to 100%. It may be lower since we removed viruses and unclassified reads.


~~~
import numpy as np
~~~
{: .language-python}

We can create a basic sanity check based on above ideas. For each rank individually,
the relative abundance should sum up to (maximally) 100 in every sample.


~~~
for rank in abundance.columns.unique(level="rank"):
    view = abundance.loc[:, abundance.columns.get_loc_level(rank, level="rank")[0]]
    total = view.sum(axis=1)
    assert ((total < 100.0) | np.isclose(total, 100.0)).all()

How many variables (columns, features) do we actually have per rank?

Since we have the most variables at the species level and because I wouldn't outright trust MGS' ability to distinguish strains, we will use the species level for our machine learning tasks. We can always go to a higher taxonomic rank to test performance on more aggregate signals.

This was a lot of work, you may think, and we haven't even done any machine learning yet! You are completely right about that feeling. According to a white paper by Google engineers, creating machine learning models is a tiny fraction of the work.

## Introduction to Machine Learning

Andrew Ng, a prominent machine learning expert, has defined machine learning as "the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed." This workshop is meant to give a quick introduction to some of the techniques one can use to build algorithms that meet this criterion. Specifically, we will discuss the following sub-fields within machine learning:

 * **Dimensionality Reduction** (for analyzing and visualizing high-dimensional data sets)
 * **Clustering** (for grouping similar objects in a high dimensional space)
 * **Classification** (for using labeled data to infer labels for unlabeled data)
 * **Anomaly Detection** (for finding outliers in a data set)
 
Let's dive in!

## Dimensionality Reduction

Our relative abundances data set at the species level has a large number of variables (features in machine learning lingo). We have 1265 features and only 800 samples. Microbiome data are often also quite sparse that means most species are only observed in a small number of samples.

Such "high-dimensional" data sets can be quite hard to work with and reason about, not to mention impossible to visualize. High-dimensional data also pose specific challenges to many machine learning models (see [The Curse of Dimensionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality)). To work around these challenges, it's often helpful to reduce the number of dimensions required to express a given data set.

One popular way to reduce the dimensionality of a data set is to use a technique called [**Principal Component Analysis**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis). PCA tries to find a lower dimensional representation of data points by projecting them down into a smaller dimensional space in a way that minimizes loss of information.

To get an intuition about PCA, suppose you have points in two dimensions, and you wish to reduce the dimensionality of your data set to a single dimension. To do so, you could find the center of the points then create a line $L$ with a random orientation that passes through that center. One can then project each point onto $L$ such that an imaginary line between the point and $L$ forms a right angle. Within this "projection", each 2D point can be represented by just its position along the 1D line $L$, effectively giving us a 1D representation of the point's position in its original space. Furthermore, we can use the difference between the largest and smallest values of points projected onto $L$ as a measure of the amount of "variance" or "spread" within the data captured by $L$. The greater this spread, the greater the amount of "signal" from the original data set is represented in the projection.

If one were to slowly rotate $L$ and continue measuring the difference between the greatest and smallest values on $L$ at each orientation, one could find the orientation of the projection line that minimizes information loss (maximizes spread). This line of minimal information loss is shown in pink below. Once that line is discovered, we can project all of our points onto that lower-dimensional embedding. See the red points below when the black line is colinear with the pink line:

What makes this kind of dimensionality reduction useful for research? There are two primary uses: (visual) data exploration and data analysis.

### Exploratory data visualization with UMAP

Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) is a dimension reduction technique that can be used for visualization but also for general non-linear dimension reduction. The author Leland McInnes has a recorded [presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq6iPZVUxZU) about how the method works in detail.

UMAP considers the distances between samples in a particular space (the manifold)
and projects those distances to a Cartesian coordinate system with typically two dimensions. That means we need to transform our relative abundances into a square
distance matrix that contains the pairwise distance between every sample.

In microbiome analyses, a common metric to compare samples is the [Bray-Curtis dissimilarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bray%E2%80%93Curtis_dissimilarity). It is a $\beta$-diversity measure since we can use it to compare samples from different
ecological niches. We use scikit-bio for a fast implementation of this measure.

Now we are ready to create a lower dimensional projection of this distance matrix.

We would like to take this opportunity to introduce a cool (and in this case useful) feature of Jupyter: interactivity. In order to make the interactivity work as intended, we will define a few functions. One for the UMAP, another to plot the result, and a third to handle the interactivity.

## Clustering

Clustering is a powerful machine learning technique and one that often requires some kind of distance metric. The goal of a clustering algorithm is to create some groups of observations, where each group contains similar observations.

There are a variety of methods for clustering vectors, including [density-based clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBSCAN), [hierarchical clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_clustering), and [centroid clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis). One of the most intuitive and most commonly used centroid-based methods is [K-Means Clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering).

Given a collection of points in a space, K-Means selects *K* "centroid" points randomly (colored green below), then assigns each non-centroid point to the centroid to which it's closest. Using these preliminary groupings, the next step is to find the geometric center of each group, using the same technique one would use to find the center of a square. These group centers become the new centroids, and again each point is assigned to the centroid to which it's closest. This process continues until centroid movement falls below some minimal movement threshold, after which the clustering is complete.

As discussed before, we use PCA to reduce the number of dimensions in our data
to two.

## Classification

The goal of a classification task is to predict whether a given observation in a data set possesses some particular property or attribute. To make these predictions, we measure the attributes of several labeled data observations, then compare unknown observations to those measurements.

In our data set we have microbiome samples labeled either as 'industrial' or 'non-industrial'. Scikit-learn can help us to split out data into a training set
and a testing set.

### K-Nearest neighbors classifiers

With a [$K$-nearest neighbors classifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm), we start with a labeled data set. We then add new, unlabeled observations to the data. For each, we consult the $K$ labeled observations to which the unlabeled observation is closest, where $K$ is an odd integer we use for all classifications. We then find the most common label among those $K$ observations (the "$K$-nearest neighbors") and give the new observation that label.

The following diagram shows this scenario. Our new observation (represented by the question mark) has some points near it that are labeled with a triangle or star. Suppose we have chosen to use 3 for our value of $K$. In that case, we consult the 3 nearest labeled points near the question mark. Those 3 nearest neighbors have labels: star, triangle, triangle. Using a majority vote, we give the question mark a triangle label.

![](images/knn.gif)

Examining the plot above, we can see that if $K$ were set to 1, we would classify the question mark as a star, but if K is 3 or 5, we would classify the question mark as a triangle. That is to say, $K$ is an important parameter in a $K$-nearest neighbors classifier.

Let's see how we can use our labeled microbiome samples for classification.

With scikit-learn's convenience function, we split our data into a training set
and a test set. By default the size is approximately 3:1.

For each observation we pass as input to `knn_clf.predict()`, the function returns a label (either 0 or 1). Just like that, we've trained a machine learning classifier and classified some test data!

The classification example above shows how we can classify just a single point in space, but suppose we want to analyze the way a classifier would classify each possible point in some space. To do so, we can transform our space into a grid of units, then classify each point in that grid. Analyzing a space in this way is known as identifying a classifier's [**decision boundary**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_boundary), because this analysis shows one the boundaries between different classification outcomes in the space. This kind of analysis is very helpful in training machine learning models, because studying a classifier's decision boundary can help one see how to improve the classifier.

Let's take a look at the decision boundary of our classifier:


~~~
def plot_decision_boundary(clf, X, labels, h=0.1):
    # Plot the decision boundary. For that, we will assign a color to each
    # point in the mesh [x_min, x_max]x[y_min, y_max].
    x_min, x_max = X[:, 0].min() - 1, X[:, 0].max() + 1
    y_min, y_max = X[:, 1].min() - 1, X[:, 1].max() + 1
    xx, yy = np.meshgrid(np.arange(x_min, x_max, h), np.arange(y_min, y_max, h))
    Z = clf.predict_proba(np.c_[xx.ravel(), yy.ravel()])[:, 1]

    # Put the result into a color plot
    Z = Z.reshape(xx.shape)
    plt.contourf(xx, yy, Z, cmap=plt.cm.RdBu, alpha=0.8)

    # Plot also the training points
    for key, sub in labels.groupby("label", as_index=False, sort=False):
        plt.scatter(X[sub.index, 0], X[sub.index, 1], edgecolor="black", label=key)

    plt.legend(loc="best")
    plt.show()
~~~
{: .language-python}


~~~
knn_clf = KNeighborsClassifier(5).fit(train_abundance, train_label)
~~~
{: .language-python}


~~~
plot_decision_boundary(
    knn_clf,
    train_abundance,
    pd.DataFrame({"label": train_label}).reset_index(drop=True),
)
~~~
{: .language-python}

<img src="../fig/rmd-03-unnamed-chunk-2-7.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-64" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-64" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

For each pixel in the plot above, we retrieve the $K$ closest points with known labels. We then use a majority vote of those labels to assign the label of the pixel. This is exactly analogous to predicting a label for an unlabeled point. In both cases, we take a majority vote of the $K$ closest points with known labels. Working in this way, we can use labeled data to classify unlabeled data. That's all there is to $K$-nearest neighbors classification!

It's worth noting that $K$-nearest neighbors is only one of many popular classification algorithms. From a high-level point of view, each classification algorithm works in a similar way. Each requires a certain number of observations with known labels and each uses those labeled observations to classify unlabeled observations. However, different classification algorithms use different logic to assign a label to new observations which means different classification algorithms have very different decision boundaries.

In the chart below, each row plots the decision boundaries several classifiers give the same data set. Notice how some classifiers work better with certain data shapes.

## Anomaly Detection

[Anomaly detection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anomaly_detection) refers to the identification of anomalies, or outliers, in data sets. While detecting anomalies in a single dimension can be quite simple, finding anomalies in high-dimensional space is a difficult problem.

One technique for classifying anomalies in high-dimensional data sets is an [Isolation Forest](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/zhouzh/zhouzh.files/publication/icdm08b.pdf). An Isolation Forest identifies outliers in a data set by randomly dividing a space until each point is isolated from each other. After repeating this procedure several times, the Isolation Forest identifies points that are more quickly isolated from other points as outliers.

[This illustration](https://s3.amazonaws.com/duhaime/blog/visualizations/isolation-forests.html) demonstrates the method by which these outliers are quickly identified. Isolated points are colored green and labeled with the iteration on which they were isolated. If you repeat the procedure several times, you'll see the outlier is consistently isolated quickly, which allows the Isolation Forest to identify that point as an outlier.

If we run the simulation above a number of times, we should see the outlier point is consistently isolated quickly, while it usually takes more iterations to isolate the other points. This is the chief intuition behind the Isolation Forests outlier classification strategy. Outliers are isolated quickly because they are farther from other points in the data set.

Let's try this on our microbiome samples.

We see that any samples outside the central area is classified as an outlier. In just a few lines of code, we can create, train, and deploy a machine learning model for detecting outliers in high-dimensional data!

### Removed samples

In the original study, some samples were removed. Can our classifier detect them as outliers?
