## Native Pandas plotting


~~~
import pandas as pd
~~~
{: .language-python}

Let's work with the familiar growth data from last episode.


~~~
growth = pd.read_csv("data/yeast-growth.csv")
~~~
{: .language-python}

Pandas provides a few [quick plotting methods](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/intro_tutorials/04_plotting.html). It uses matplotlib under the hood to generate graphics.


~~~
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
~~~
{: .language-python}

The default `plot` method draws lines for every numeric column in the data frame
using the index as the horizontal axis.


~~~
growth.plot()
~~~
{: .language-python}

<img src="../fig/rmd-02-unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-6" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-6" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

We can specify a different kind of plot, choosing columns explicitly.


~~~
growth.plot.scatter("timepoint", "od")
~~~
{: .language-python}

<img src="../fig/rmd-02-unnamed-chunk-2-3.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-7" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-7" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Other types of plots include a histogram. You can also see that we use matplotlib
directly in order to customize the plot further.


~~~
growth["concentration"].plot.hist(bins=30)
~~~
{: .language-python}



~~~
<AxesSubplot:ylabel='Frequency'>
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
plt.xlabel("concentration")
~~~
{: .language-python}



~~~
Text(0.5, 0, 'concentration')
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
plt.show()
~~~
{: .language-python}

<img src="../fig/rmd-02-unnamed-chunk-2-5.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-8" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-8" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Another type of plot for showing distributions is the box plot which, again, by default uses numeric columns.


~~~
growth.plot.box()
~~~
{: .language-python}

<img src="../fig/rmd-02-unnamed-chunk-2-7.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-9" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-9" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

My opinion on native Pandas plotting:

  * Great for quick visualization
  * Unlike base matplotlib, can refer to data by column name
  * Selecting data using Pandas indexing is awesome
  * Customizing figures with matplotlib commands can be tedious
  * Adding trend lines, regression plots, managing colors can become a pain in the neck

## State of plotting in Python

<https://pyviz.org/overviews/index.html>

* Overwhelming number of options
* Why we chose [altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/index.html) for this workshop:
  * It based on [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/)'s visualization grammar
  * [Vega](http://vega.github.io/vega) in turn is based on [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) thus it natively works in your browser and provides interactivity
  * Main authors Jake Vanderplas and Brian Granger are well known figures in the
    Python visualization space and as academics can be expected to keep maintaining the project
    
## Grammar of Graphics

The [grammar of graphics](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387245447) was described by Leland Wilkinson. It was later [updated by Hadley Wickham](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1198/jcgs.2009.07098) with ideas developed during the creation of his famous `R` plotting software `ggplot2`.
[This blog has a decent summary of both.](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-comprehensive-guide-to-the-grammar-of-graphics-for-effective-visualization-of-multi-dimensional-1f92b4ed4149)
In lose terms, the idea is that every visualization has the following ingredients:

* data (ideally in a tidy format)
* a coordinate system to draw in the data
* visual marks (geometries) that represent the data
* aesthetics that describe which data encode visual properties

This all sounds a bit abstract. Let's dive into examples.

## Introduction to altair

We need the altair package, of course.


~~~
import altair as alt
width = 800
height = 600
~~~
{: .language-python}

Here we create an altair
`Chart` object with our tidy growth data frame. The default coordinate system is Cartesian with two axes. We encode our data and specify that
the time points should describe our x-axis coordinate and optical density the y-axis coordinate. Finally,
we want this two-dimensional data to be displayed by the visual mark _points_.

The default output size is a bit small in my opinion so we configure it to be a bit larger.


~~~
alt.Chart(growth).encode(
    x="timepoint", y="od"
).mark_point().configure_view(continuousWidth=width, continuousHeight=height)
~~~
{: .language-python}



![Basic point mark plot](../fig/basic_point.png)

We can, at any point, store our current chart specification in a variable and later
apply further specifications to it.


~~~
base = alt.Chart(growth).encode(x="timepoint", y="od")
~~~
{: .language-python}

How about using lines as the visual mark?


~~~
base.mark_line().configure_view(continuousWidth=width, continuousHeight=height)
~~~
{: .language-python}



![Ungrouped line mark plot](../fig/ungrouped_line.png)

The above plot has the same problems as the Pandas default plot. Our data was recorded per _well_. We can use this variable to encode a third dimension that
groups our data. Common options are colour or shape/linetype.


~~~
base.encode(color="well").mark_line(point=True).configure_view(
    continuousWidth=width, continuousHeight=height
)
~~~
{: .language-python}



![Line mark plot grouped by color](../fig/color_grouped_line.png)

This looks much better already. We also changed the visual mark to be a point and line.

Instead of defining separate groups for each growth time course, we can separate
each individual time course into its own plot. This is known as facetting. Using
facets can be handy but information is more spread out. Comparing different time
courses is harder in this format.


~~~
base.mark_line(point=True).facet("well", columns=3)
~~~
{: .language-python}



![Faceted line mark plot](../fig/facet_line.png)

Let's look again at the individual data points grouped by _well_.


~~~
chart = alt.Chart(growth).encode(x="timepoint", y="od", color="well").mark_point()
chart.configure_view(continuousWidth=width, continuousHeight=height)
~~~
{: .language-python}



![Colored point mark plot](../fig/color_point.png)

Instead of connecting each consecutive data point with a straight line, we can
apply a smoothing data transformation. In the following example, we use a
[locally estimated scatterplot smoothing (LOESS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_regression) transformation.


~~~
(
    chart
    + chart.transform_loess(
        "timepoint", "od", groupby=["well"], bandwidth=0.15
    ).mark_line()
).configure_view(continuousWidth=width, continuousHeight=height)
~~~
{: .language-python}



![LOESS transform plot](../fig/transform_loess.png)

We can now combine the concepts that we have learnt to introduce a fourth dimension,
the measured concentration. Since the concentration is a measured quantity, we
use a continuous colour scale to represent it. We still group our data by wells
and apply smoothing. As an example, we vary the point shape.

Please not that for the first time we explicitly encode the type of the variables.
`Q` means quantitative (continuous) and `N` means nominal (categorical).


~~~
fancy_chart = alt.Chart(growth).encode(
    x="timepoint:Q",
    y="od:Q",
    detail="well:N",
    color=alt.Color("concentration:Q", scale=alt.Scale(type="log", scheme="greenblue")),
)
(
    fancy_chart.transform_loess(
        "timepoint", "od", groupby=["well", "concentration"], bandwidth=0.1
    ).mark_line()
    + fancy_chart.encode(shape="well:N").mark_point()
).configure_view(continuousWidth=width, continuousHeight=height)
~~~
{: .language-python}



![Fancy plot with grouping, LOESS transform, and color by concentration](../fig/fancy.png)

## Other visual marks

Naturally, altair offers more than just lines and points.

An interactive histogram:


~~~
brush = alt.selection_interval(encodings=["x"])

base = (
    alt.Chart(growth).mark_bar().encode(y="count():Q").properties(width=600, height=100)
)

alt.vconcat(
    base.encode(
        alt.X(
            "od:Q", bin=alt.Bin(maxbins=30, extent=brush), scale=alt.Scale(domain=brush)
        )
    ),
    base.encode(
        alt.X("od:Q", bin=alt.Bin(maxbins=30)),
    ).add_selection(brush),
)
~~~
{: .language-python}

Or how about boxplot of optical density per well.


~~~
alt.Chart(growth).mark_boxplot().encode(x="well:O", y="od:Q").configure_view(continuousWidth=width, continuousHeight=height)
~~~
{: .language-python}



![A boxplot showing the distribution of optical density grouped by well.](../fig/boxplot.png)

Many more [examples](https://altair-viz.github.io/gallery/index.html) exist.
